/*
    Notes
    React is a frontend framework that adds more features to improve vanilla JS
    Firstly, React adds components for reusability and modularity
    Secondly, React adds state for dynamic content and the virtual DOM for performance
    Thirdly, React adds props for passing data between components

    React UI strongly benefits from planning out your components before you start coding
    Imperative vs Declarative: Imperative is telling the computer what to do, Declarative is telling the computer what you want to do
    React is declarative, you tell it what you want to do and it does it for you

    
    Vite + React
    installation: npm create vite@latest
